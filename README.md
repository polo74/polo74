## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

This github is a mess... so take what you want... but be careful! 

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on cybersecurity
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning angular and web languages (but also cybersecurity lol)
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on whatever you want
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with nothing (for yet...)
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my hobbies... or IT
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: homing pigeons
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: void
- âš¡ Fun fact: still loading...
